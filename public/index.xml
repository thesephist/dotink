      <description>In the early days of Ink, the most interesting thing Ink programs could do was take some textual input, and output some text back to the terminal. While that was useful for testing the language, it was far from interesting.</description>

      <title>Macro elegance: the magical simplicity of Lisp macros</title>
      <link>https://dotink.co/posts/macros/</link>

      <description>Lisp is a homoiconic programming language &amp;ndash; Lisp program source code is also a first-class data structure in Lisp, made of nested lists of symbols. This allows Lisp programs to define and use really elegant macros, pieces of syntax defined in the Lisp program itself.</description>

      <title>A retrospective on toy programming language design mistakes</title>
      <link>https://dotink.co/posts/pl-design-mistakes/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve written a few toy programming languages, mostly of the functional paradigm. The most significant of those is Ink, but I&amp;rsquo;ve also written a Lisp-style mini-language called Xin, and now a proper Lisp in Klisp. Besides those implementations, I&amp;rsquo;ve also played with a half dozen other concepts and ideas for alternative programming languages as I&amp;rsquo;ve learned about array programming, pipelines, shells, and other more esoteric concepts in programming language design.</description>

      <description>Building on my progress and positive experience with Klisp, I recently created Nightvale, an interactive notebook in the browser for literate programming and communicating computational ideas using Klisp code. On Nightvale, I can create docs that combine rich (Markdown-esque) text, mathematical notation, and runnable Klisp code to explain ideas.</description>

      <guid>https://dotink.co/posts/klisp/</guid>
      <description>Klisp (named after inK LISP) is a very minimal Lisp environment with a core written in about 200 lines of Ink. In addition to the interpreter itself, Klisp also includes an interactive repl and a small standard library that makes operations on lists and Klisp values easy and idiomatic.</description>

      <description>I like thinking about software as if it were matter, following some pre-ordained laws of nature as if they occupied real space and time. Of course, the metaphor often only stretches so far, but I think metaphors of physics in software can give us great mental models for thinking about the complexity that we create when we build software, which are the most complex machines humans design.</description>

      <guid>https://dotink.co/posts/histools/</guid>
      <description>Today I made Histools, a small set of tools for visualizing browser history data from Apple&amp;rsquo;s Safari browser. It renders a heatmap of pages visited on Safari over time, alongside a searchable, sorted list of pages I&amp;rsquo;ve visited most often with mini-heatmaps for each URL.</description>

      <guid>https://dotink.co/posts/schrift-code/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a new big project recently: a faster, better-designed, more versatile interpreter for Ink, rewritten from the ground-up, called Schrift.
Schrift is an experimental runtime for Ink focused on performance and runtime instrumentation capabilities, and is still very much under development.</description>

      <title>System calls from the Go runtime in the Minimum Viable Go Program</title>
      <link>https://dotink.co/posts/go-syscalls/</link>

      <guid>https://dotink.co/posts/go-syscalls/</guid>
      <description>Go, despite being a fully compiled language, has a sizeable runtime that helps Go programs handle things like multithreading, input/output, global variable initialization, and memory safety. To provide all of these convenience and safety features, the Go runtime interacts with the operating system in ways that are often opaque to the Go code we write.</description>

      <description>Today, I published the first version of ink-vscode, which adds support for the Ink language to the Visual Studio Code editor.
So far, there has only been one kind of editor support for the Ink language, in the form of a syntax definition for the Vim editor.</description>

      <title>Syntax highlighting Ink programs with the September toolchain</title>

      <guid>https://dotink.co/posts/syntax-highlight/</guid>
      <description>Although Ink is over a year old now, it has never had a dedicated syntax highlighter. When I write Ink programs, which is the vast majority of my time reading Ink code, I&amp;rsquo;ve used a vim syntax file to take advantage of vim&amp;rsquo;s syntax highlighting capabilities.</description>

      <title>The September compiler: translating Ink to JavaScript</title>

      <guid>https://dotink.co/posts/september/</guid>
      <description>September is an Ink to JavaScript compiler, written in Ink itself. It&amp;rsquo;s so-called because it&amp;rsquo;s the first in a forthcoming series of autumn-month-themed tools written in and for Ink:
 September, a compiler to JavaScript, which is what this post is about August, an assembler and linker, which is yet to be started October, a symbolic mathematics environment, which is even more yet to be started, but which I&amp;rsquo;m really excited about  Autumn months are great, especially because august is the best song on folklore which is a lyrical and aural masterpiece by the queen of pop Taylor Swift herself, but that&amp;rsquo;s for me to go on about on a different website.</description>

      <description>Good software engineering is concerned with two kinds of scale: operational scale and engineering scale.
Operational scale measures how many processors and compute nodes are in your production infrastructure, and how many requests and responses the system handles every second.</description>

      <description>Preface Last Saturday, I hosted a small casual hangout discussing recent developments in NLP, focusing on OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s new GPT-3 language model. Not being in the machine learning field, I wanted to understand what the excitement was about, and what these new language models enabled us to build.</description>

      <description>ANSI escape codes Most of the time, we think of a computer terminal as a place to output text. We generate logs and print output from programs to the terminal, and interact with the shell by typing lines in and getting lines out.</description>

      <title>Binary search for rational approximations of irrational numbers</title>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s a reasonably simple rational approximation of Pi?
We might take a naive approach and simply take a fraction like \(\frac{314159265}{100000000}\) and reduce it to get a fractional representation of an arbitrary decimal form of Pi. But this is boring, and requires large denominators to be precise.</description>

      <description>This year, I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending more time reading papers about computer science and software engineering. I&amp;rsquo;m not in academia, so I don&amp;rsquo;t always read papers in the cutting edge of the field, but I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed reading seminal papers written at the birth of interesting technologies.</description>

      <guid>https://dotink.co/posts/traceur/</guid>
      <description>Traceur (pronounced like trace + connoisseur) is a path tracing renderer written in Ink. Traceur is capable of rendering scenes with spherical objects, realistic shadows, reflections, refractions, and depth of field. Internally, Traceur uses well-defined interfaces for working with shapes, materials, and scene descriptions, so it&amp;rsquo;s easy to extend with new textures and lighting effects.</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s Ink? Ink is a functional, general-purpose, interpreted scripting language. It&amp;rsquo;s dynamically and strongly typed. Ink programs can be web servers, short scripts, drawing programs, or anything else that interfaces with files and networks. Ink is designed to be minimal and simple, first and foremost.</description>
