        <p>What&rsquo;s a reasonably simple rational approximation of Pi?</p>
<p>We might take a naive approach and simply take a fraction like \(\frac{314159265}{100000000}\) and reduce it to get a fractional representation of an arbitrary decimal form of Pi. But this is boring, and requires large denominators to be precise. Can we do any better?</p>
<p>One possible answer is \(\frac{102573}{32650} = 3.1415926493&hellip;\) which is pretty darn close, accurate to 8 decimal places after rounding, while keeping a much smaller denominator. Want to get more precise? We can take \(\frac{4272943}{1360120} = 3.14159265358939&hellip;\) which is accurate to 12 decimal places with only 7 significant figures in the denominator.</p>
<p>It turns out there&rsquo;s an interesting way to generate these few-significant-figures approximations of irrational and transcendental numbers efficiently, and the process resembles binary search very closely. I want to explore the parallels and dive into the binary search approximation method in this post.</p>
<h2 id="mediants">Mediants</h2>
<p>The approximation method I&rsquo;ll outline here recursively computes mediants of fractions. A <em>mediant</em> is an operation defined on two fractions&hellip; sort of&hellip; as follows.</p>
<p>$$Mediant\left(\frac{a}{b}, \frac{c}{d}\right) := \frac{a + c}{b + d}$$</p>
<p>The mediant operation is technically not a function on two fractions, since reduced and non-reduced forms of fractions will lead to different results. Technically we should define it as a function on two ordered pairs. But I&rsquo;ll call this process the mediant <em>operation</em> for simplicity in this post.</p>
<p>There are a few interesting things about a mediant of two fractions. The most interesting property of the mediant is called the <em>mediant inequality</em>, and it states that a mediant of two distinct fractions will always be between the two fractions.</p>
<p>$$\frac{a}{b} &lt; \frac{c}{d} \implies \frac{a}{b} &lt; Mediant\left(\frac{a}{b}, \frac{c}{d}\right) &lt; \frac{c}{d}$$</p>
<p>You might already be seeing some clues as to how we can use this to binary-search a range of numbers. But first, let us take an aside into some related ideas in sequences of rational numbers.</p>
<h3 id="farey-sequences">Farey sequences</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farey_sequence">Farey sequences</a> are a countably infinite set of finite sequences of fractions. We form a Farey sequence of order \(n\) by enumerating all reduced fractions with denominators less than or equal to \(n\) in the range \([0, 1]\).</p>
<p>The first 5 Farey sequences are</p>
<p>$$F_{1} = \left\{
\frac{0}{1},
\frac{1}{1}
\right\}$$</p>
<p>$$F_{2} = \left\{
\frac{0}{1},
\frac{1}{2},
\frac{1}{1}
\right\}$$</p>
<p>$$F_{3} = \left\{
\frac{0}{1},
\frac{1}{3},
\frac{1}{2},
\frac{2}{3},
\frac{1}{1}
\right\}$$</p>
<p>$$F_{4} = \left\{
\frac{0}{1},
\frac{1}{4},
\frac{1}{3},
\frac{1}{2},
\frac{2}{3},
\frac{3}{4},
\frac{1}{1}
\right\}$$</p>
<p>$$F_{5} = \left\{
\frac{0}{1},
\frac{1}{5},
\frac{1}{4},
\frac{1}{3},
\frac{2}{5},
\frac{1}{2},
\frac{3}{5},
\frac{2}{3},
\frac{3}{4},
\frac{4}{5},
\frac{1}{1}
\right\}$$</p>
<p>Farey sequences have a few notable properties for our task of approximating irrational numbers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Any fraction in the Farey sequence appears only once, in its most reduced representation, by definition.</li>
<li>Farey sequences of increasing order contain fractions that more finely cover the \([0, 1]\) interval. In the limit of \(\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} F_{n}\) the Farey sequence includes exactly all rationals in the closed interval \([0, 1]\).</li>
</ul>
<p>Given these facts, we can simplify our task of finding a small-denominator fractional approximation of a number, to the problem of finding a number in a Farey sequence of sufficiently high order (for a good enough approximation) that is closest to our irrational number.</p>
<h3 id="stern-brocot-tree">Stern-Brocot tree</h3>
<p>A closely related structure to the Farey sequence is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern%E2%80%93Brocot_tree">Stern-Brocot tree</a>, which is a binary tree produced by recursively taking mediants of fractions, starting from 0 and 1.</p>
<p><img src="/img/farey-sb-tree.svg" alt="Stern-Brocot tree, Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 from Aaron Rotenberg"></p>
<p><em>(Diagram courtesy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern%E2%80%93Brocot_tree#/media/File:SternBrocotTree.svg">Aaron Rotenberg, Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0</a>)</em></p>
<p>The Stern-Brocot tree is another way of enumerating all reduced-form fractions in the unit interval. However, these terms don&rsquo;t appear in the same order as in a Farey sequence &ndash; fractions with denominator \(n\) may appear in a tree node of depth less than \(n\), as in \(\frac{2}{5}\) which appears at depth 4 above.</p>
<p>Traversing the Stern-Brocot tree programmatically is easier than computing Farey sequences of increasing order, and fractions in the tree retain the two important properties of fractions that appear in Farey sequences.</p>
<ul>
<li>Any fraction in the Stern-Brocot tree appears exactly once, in its most reduced form.</li>
<li>Fractions at increasing depths of the Stern-Brocot tree more finely cover the unit interval.</li>
</ul>
<p>These properties of the tree make the Stern-Brocot tree an excellent starting point for our search for rational approximations of real numbers.</p>
<h2 id="approximating-irrationals-with-the-stern-brocot-tree">Approximating irrationals with the Stern-Brocot tree</h2>
<p>I first found this process of approximating irrational numbers with the Farey sequence and the Stern-Brocot tree from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LKy3lrkTRA">this video by Matt Parker</a>. The process stood out to me, so I thought I&rsquo;d implement it in an Ink script and write about it, which became this post.</p>
<p>We can approximate any real number in the unit interval by traversing the Stern-Brocot tree, following branches that better approximate the target number at each depth, until either our approximation is good enough, or the denominator is too large.</p>
<p>For example, to approximate the number 0.37, we take the following branches in the tree at each depth</p>
<p>$$\frac{0}{1}
\rightarrow \frac{1}{2}
\rightarrow \frac{1}{3}
\rightarrow \frac{2}{5}
\rightarrow \frac{3}{8}
\rightarrow \frac{4}{11} = 0.\overline{36}$$</p>
<p>We can also extend this method to rationally approximate all reals, by splitting numbers outside of the unit interval to their whole number part and a fractional part, and then computing a rational approximation of the fractional part. From our previous example, we also know that a similar approximation for 1.37 is \(\frac{11 + 4}{11} = \frac{15}{11}\).</p>
<p>An Ink program that executes this search is</p>
