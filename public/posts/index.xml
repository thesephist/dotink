      <title>Behind the scenes: building the Ink codebase browser</title>

      <description>The Ink Codebase Browser is a refined tool for exploring open-source projects on GitHub. Compared to the experience of clicking through file hierarchies and previews on GitHubâ€™s website, this project aims to provide a much better &amp;ldquo;browsing&amp;rdquo; experience for online codebases on GitHub with a file tree, rich Markdown and image previews, and multi-pane multi-tab layouts.</description>

      <description>The Ink playground, named project &amp;ldquo;Maverick&amp;rdquo;, is a web IDE and REPL for Ink. It&amp;rsquo;s a single-page web application written in pure Ink, and makes it possible to write and run Ink programs entirely in the browser.</description>

      <title>Eliza: an isomorphic Ink app for web and native</title>

      <description>Last month, I launched Eliza, a chatbot modeled after the classic MIT conversational program and written entirely in Ink. Though the project itself isn&amp;rsquo;t novel or interesting &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s mostly a port of existing implementations of ELIZA &amp;ndash; Eliza is built as an isomorphic Ink application, meaning a substantial part of the codebase can run both natively, on a server, and on the client (a Web browser).</description>

      <title>Assembler in Ink, Part II: x86 assembly, instruction encoding, and debugging symbols</title>

      <description>This is the sequel to Assembler in Ink, Part I where I started documenting my process of building an x86 assembler in Ink.
In Part I, we looked at the high-level jobs of an assembler, and how August constructs an ELF file that an operating system (specifically Linux here) could understand and turn into a process.</description>

      <description>Over the holidays, I decided to learn about the lower level components of programs by writing an assembler and linker from scratch. Assembly and linking are two of the last steps of a typical &amp;ldquo;compile&amp;rdquo; process that generates an executable file from an assembly program.</description>

      <description>Ink is a mostly functional programming language, and Ink programs express iteration through recursion. Usually, this kind of recursion is hidden behind higher level library functions like map and each.</description>

      <title>Implementing the lambda calculus in Ink</title>

      <description>The lambda calculus is a formal model of computation, a mathematically rigorous way of thinking about what computers do. Unlike the other popular theoretical model, the Turing machine, the lambda calculus describes all computation in terms of pure functions, and functions acting on other functions.</description>

      <description>In the early days of Ink, the most interesting thing Ink programs could do was take some textual input, and output some text back to the terminal.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve written a few toy programming languages, mostly of the functional paradigm. The most significant of those is Ink, but I&amp;rsquo;ve also written a Lisp-style mini-language called Xin, and now a proper Lisp in Klisp.</description>

      <description>Building on my progress and positive experience with Klisp, I recently created Nightvale, an interactive notebook in the browser for literate programming and communicating computational ideas using Klisp code.</description>

      <title>Klisp: a Lisp in about 200 lines of Ink</title>

      <guid>https://dotink.co/posts/klisp/</guid>
      <description>Klisp (named after inK LISP) is a very minimal Lisp environment with a core written in about 200 lines of Ink. In addition to the interpreter itself, Klisp also includes an interactive repl and a small standard library that makes operations on lists and Klisp values easy and idiomatic.</description>

      <title>Weighing software abstractions to design better programs</title>
      <link>https://dotink.co/posts/weight-of-abstraction/</link>

      <guid>https://dotink.co/posts/weight-of-abstraction/</guid>
      <description>I like thinking about software as if it were matter, following some pre-ordained laws of nature as if they occupied real space and time. Of course, the metaphor often only stretches so far, but I think metaphors of physics in software can give us great mental models for thinking about the complexity that we create when we build software, which are the most complex machines humans design.</description>

      <title>Histools: visualizing my browser history over time with Ink and Torus</title>

      <description>Today I made Histools, a small set of tools for visualizing browser history data from Apple&amp;rsquo;s Safari browser. It renders a heatmap of pages visited on Safari over time, alongside a searchable, sorted list of pages I&amp;rsquo;ve visited most often with mini-heatmaps for each URL.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a new big project recently: a faster, better-designed, more versatile interpreter for Ink, rewritten from the ground-up, called Schrift.
Schrift is an experimental runtime for Ink focused on performance and runtime instrumentation capabilities, and is still very much under development.</description>

      <description>Go, despite being a fully compiled language, has a sizeable runtime that helps Go programs handle things like multithreading, input/output, global variable initialization, and memory safety.</description>

      <description>Today, I published the first version of ink-vscode, which adds support for the Ink language to the Visual Studio Code editor.
So far, there has only been one kind of editor support for the Ink language, in the form of a syntax definition for the Vim editor.</description>

      <title>Syntax highlighting Ink programs with the September toolchain</title>

      <guid>https://dotink.co/posts/syntax-highlight/</guid>
      <description>Although Ink is over a year old now, it has never had a dedicated syntax highlighter. When I write Ink programs, which is the vast majority of my time reading Ink code, I&amp;rsquo;ve used a vim syntax file to take advantage of vim&amp;rsquo;s syntax highlighting capabilities.</description>

      <description>September is an Ink to JavaScript compiler, written in Ink itself. It&amp;rsquo;s so-called because it&amp;rsquo;s the first in a forthcoming series of autumn-month-themed tools written in and for Ink:</description>

      <description>Good software engineering is concerned with two kinds of scale: operational scale and engineering scale.
Operational scale measures how many processors and compute nodes are in your production infrastructure, and how many requests and responses the system handles every second.</description>

      <description>Preface Last Saturday, I hosted a small casual hangout discussing recent developments in NLP, focusing on OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s new GPT-3 language model. Not being in the machine learning field, I wanted to understand what the excitement was about, and what these new language models enabled us to build.</description>

      <title>Better terminal output from Ink with ANSI escape codes</title>

      <description>ANSI escape codes Most of the time, we think of a computer terminal as a place to output text. We generate logs and print output from programs to the terminal, and interact with the shell by typing lines in and getting lines out.</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s a reasonably simple rational approximation of Pi?
We might take a naive approach and simply take a fraction like \(\frac{314159265}{100000000}\) and reduce it to get a fractional representation of an arbitrary decimal form of Pi.</description>

      <description>This year, I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending more time reading papers about computer science and software engineering. I&amp;rsquo;m not in academia, so I don&amp;rsquo;t always read papers in the cutting edge of the field, but I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed reading seminal papers written at the birth of interesting technologies.</description>
