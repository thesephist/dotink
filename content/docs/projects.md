## Projects

### Traceur

Traceur is a path-tracing renderer in Ink, supporting Monte-Carlo antialiasing, realistic shadows, reflections, refractions, and focus blur. I wrote about [building Traceur here](/posts/traceur/).

### Matisse

Matisse is a minimalistic gallery of generative art pieces that are written in Ink. As a web app, Matisse depends on the September compiler to compile Ink programs and algorithms down to JavaScript.
